# Session handoff

What a fresh orchestrating session must know that is not derivable from the
code. Read after CLAUDE.md. Keep this file short; move anything durable into a
lex, a decision, or a check rule and delete it here.

## The Patron's standing instructions

- **Fewer words.** Lead with the proposal or the outcome; drop rationale that
  does not change a decision.
- **Not epoch0-centric.** epoch0 (`~/projects/epoch0`, WSL) is a reference
  instance only. Never modify it; never frame designs around it.
- **Keep going unless a judgment is needed.** Mechanical findings are fixed and
  re-verified without asking; judgment (names, scope, lex boundaries, what a
  collegium may decide, licences) goes to the Patron as a petitio. This is the
  no-mistakes auto-fix-versus-escalate split, one level up.
- **Update the progress page and dossier masthead at every checkpoint**
  (after each cascade and each cleanup commit): a row on the Progress page
  + the dossier's masthead status line. Source: `docs/design/dossier/`
  (`build.sh` builds both pages; republish each with the Artifact tool at
  the links below).
- **Never relay a mid-turn Patron message into a running workflow**; answer
  between cascades. Agents given a relayed question refused their build (4b).
- Test-first with a recorded red; mechanical work is a script; evidence is
  produced, never backfilled. These are in the leges; they bind here too.

## Artifacts (Patron-visible)

- Dossier: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/d70aefcf-d87a-4918-933f-cc7b58410d4c
  (rebuild from `docs/design/dossier/head.html` + `body.html`; patch `body.html`
  with a script, never by hand-editing the built page).
- Design direction (what web I builds to; source docs/design/DIRECTION.md,
  rendered by build-arch.mjs via build.sh):
  https://claude.ai/artifact/J6LGxy2T7V7M1x3F3CrT15
- Architecture (Mermaid system map, rendered from docs/ARCHITECTURE.md by
  docs/design/dossier/build-arch.mjs via build.sh):
  https://claude.ai/artifact/WUBAJ9JceMAX5qEhgjoyuN — republish after any
  cascade that touched ARCHITECTURE.md (the design lex obliges the update).
- Progress log (per-cascade rows, split out of the dossier 2026-09-19):
  https://claude.ai/code/artifact/Rnk9m3UwfP9uexz57Zw37e — source
  `docs/design/dossier/progress-body.html`, built by the same `build.sh`.
  Checkpoints now update the PROGRESS page's row + the dossier masthead.
- UI design canvas (six screens, Patron-editable; check for external saves
  before republishing): https://claude.ai/code/artifact/a2f1b828-4648-423b-bda8-f0bc2c77fb7f
  — sources in `docs/design/canvas/` (`*.dc.html`, `canvas.json`). Re-seeding
  needs the Claude Code `design` skill's `seed-canvas.mjs` (node in WSL only).
- Design tokens: ink #16211E, accent #0B6E5F, amber #B7791F = waiting on a human
  only, ok #2E9E64, bad #C64A3A; Bricolage Grotesque / Instrument Sans /
  IBM Plex Mono.

## Environment facts

- Containment (Patron, 2026-09-19): `.claude/settings.local.json` carries the
  Bash sandbox config (bubblewrap; writes confined to repo + evidence dir,
  epoch0 and /mnt/c deny-listed) — it hard-fails until
  `sudo apt-get install bubblewrap socat` has been run in the distro.
  `.devcontainer/` is Anthropic's reference config on node:25 with the egress
  firewall, for fully contained cascade runs. Under the sandbox the tsx CLI
  cannot run (its IPC unix-socket listen is denied; docker.sock exists in this
  distro so sockets stay blocked) — the bisellium bin and every package.json
  script use `node --import tsx` instead; agents should too, never `npx tsx`.
  The sandbox also masks shell/tool config paths in the repo root as /dev/null
  devices; both ignore files carry the block so verify stays clean-tree. Repo backup: bundle at
  C:\Users\edene\bisellium-backups\; private remote github.com/edckt/bisellium (origin). Sandbox deps
  (bubblewrap, socat) installed 2026-09-19.

- Node, npm, git, `claude`, `codex`, Go, treehouse, no-mistakes exist only inside
  WSL. From a Windows-hosted session run `wsl -e bash -lc "cd ~/projects/bisellium && …"`.
  From a session whose project directory is this repo, run commands directly.
- Commit with `-c user.name=edckt -c user.email=edene.chankt@gmail.com` and the
  trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- The Workflow tool is allowed without a prompt (`.claude/settings.json`).
- Codex weekly quota was exhausted until 2026-09-21; quota-axi cannot read the
  Claude Code login (`auth_required`), so Claude posture is observed/unknown.
- Two officinae share this repo (`studio/`, `examples/sample-studio`); each lists
  the other in `source_excludes`.

## Where things stand (2026-09-19, cascade 9 complete)

- Cascades 1–7 in the dossier progress log. Suite green; both
  officinae 0 blocking.
- **Cascade 8** (6 commits): visual pass, process fixes (`standing_rules`,
  check rules, screen map, review prompt, inbox click-to-select).
- **Cascade 9** (3 commits): W-026 complete — per-opus branching,
  `bisellium branch`/`merge`, `run --opus`.
- **Cascade 10 landed**:
  - W-028: `process.checkpoint` check rule, `bisellium close` command
    (validates opus state, guards the checkpoint flow), CLI wired.
- **Backlog (priority order)**:
  1. **W-028** (building) — patron-as-agent: `bisellium close` command,
     fully autonomous patron sella. checkpoint rule landed.
  2. **W-027** — container lifecycle: prune, cleanup, disk-aware cascade
     start. Needed once parallel workstreams run.
  3. W-022 — evidence content rules (P-005)
  4. W-023 — containment scoping (P-004)
- D-014 model pair: Sonnet 5 builders, Opus 4.6 reviews (unchanged).
- Then: web II (Board screen, drawer, SSE live), web III (Swimlane, Agents,
  Graph), autonomy L2, adapters + desktop.
- **Process note**: Playwright / UI integration testing identified as a gap —
  static rendering tests cover structure but not interaction.

## Naming

Roman civic/guild vocabulary; see GLOSSARY.md. Wire attributes (`workflow.*`)
and lifecycle state ids stay English. Earlier working names (Gantry, Backlot,
Atrium) appear only in history.
