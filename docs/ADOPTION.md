# Adopting Bisellium

## Vocabulary

Bisellium's product-facing contract uses Latin names. The wire-level
`workflow.*` / `gen_ai.* ` / `provider.*` attribute names and the lifecycle
state ids (`backlog`, `greenlit`, `building`, `verifying`, `review`, `done`,
`halted`) and gate/digest/provider status enums are the OTel-style wire
format, not product vocabulary — they stay English everywhere, including
inside Latin-named files.

| Latin | English |
|---|---|
| Patron | Owner |
| Collegium | Department |
| Magister | Lead |
| Sella | Seat / actor |
| Lex | Charter |
| Acta | Digest |
| Petitio | Ask / thread |
| Opus | Work item |
| Probatio | Gate |
| Traditio | Handoff |
| Aerarium | Budget |
| Stipendium | Allowance |

A Bisellium studio is a directory (usually a repo, or a folder in one) with the
files below. Agents and humans write these; the console reads them; `bisellium
check` validates them — every rule here is one `check` can fail. See
`examples/sample-studio` for a complete instance and `examples/fixtures` for
what failing looks like.

```
bisellium.yml              manifest: version, patron, collegia, sellae, probationes, wip_limit, defaults
leges/<collegium>.md       one lex per collegium (LEX_TEMPLATE.md)
opera/<id>.md               one file per opus, YAML front matter + notes
petitiones/<id>.md          questions to the Patron not about one opus; petitiones the Patron opened
acta/<date>-<slug>.md       inform-and-proceed entries
aerarium/<period>.yml       allowances per collegium — burn is derived, never written
usage.yml                observed provider limit telemetry
receipts/<sella>/<sessionId>.json  run receipts written by `bisellium run` (start + exit)
```

Planned, not yet built: `memoria/sellae/`, `decisions/`, `archive/`, and the
docs registry.

## bisellium.yml

```yaml
bisellium: 1                      # contract version; check refuses any other
studio: Sample Studio
patron: patron                    # the Patron's role id
timezone: Europe/London
collegia:
  - { id: engineering, name: Engineering, magister: eng-lead, fallback: producer, lex: leges/engineering.md }
sellae:
  - { id: eng-lead, collegium: engineering, kind: agent, model: claude-opus-5 }
probationes:
  - { id: tests,  name: Tests,        kind: automated, command: "npm test" }
  - { id: review, name: Lead review,  kind: agent }
  - { id: patron, name: Patron call,  kind: human }
review_probatio: review           # probatio id that gates "review" state (default "review")
wip_limit: 3                      # items in building + verifying, studio-wide
defaults:                         # optional overrides of the dossier's Defaults table
  handoff_stale_days: 3
```

Ids must be unique within collegia, sellae and probationes. Every magister and
fallback must be a declared sella. A lex, if declared, must exist and
should contain "Decides alone", "Digests" and "Asks" sections.

`command` (a shell command) is optional on a `kind: automated` probatio; it is
what `bisellium verify <opus-id>` runs to fill that gate's `status`/
`evidence`/`certifies` in the opus itself (see `## opera/<id>.md` and
`## Running check` below). An automated probatio with no `command` is never
touched by `verify` — its evidence has to come from elsewhere.

## Lifecycle (fixed)

`backlog → greenlit → building → verifying → review → done`, plus `halted`.
Greenlit is the Patron's slate decision; everything after it is the collegium's.
State is asserted by the magister, but `check` fails a state the evidence cannot
support: `review` needs every automated gate and every other agent gate passed;
`done` needs all non-human gates passed and any recorded human gate passed or
waived. `waived` needs a `reason` and is never allowed on an automated gate.
WIP counts `building` + `verifying`; `review` waits on someone else.

## opera/<id>.md

```yaml
---
id: W-004
title: Inventory drag-and-drop
kind: feature
collegium: engineering
sella: builder-1
state: review
probationes:
  tests:  { status: passed, evidence: ci/812.log, certifies: a1b2c3d }
  review: { status: passed, evidence: reviews/W-004.md, certifies: a1b2c3d }
  patron: { status: pending }
tokens: 412000
traditio: { sella: builder-1, stage: review, next: await patron call, blocked_on: patron, at: 2026-09-17T09:58Z }
---
Free-form notes below the front matter.
```

Required keys: `id` (must equal the filename), `title`, `kind`, `collegium`,
`state` — all non-empty strings. `traditio` (`sella`, `stage`, `next`,
`blocked_on`, `at` as an ISO date) is required on every active item
(`building`, `verifying`, `review`) and validated wherever present; it is stale
past `handoff_stale_days`. `halted` items require `reason` and `resume_when`,
and `halted_at` so their age can be tracked. A `pending` gate of kind `human`
is what "needs you" means. Passed and failed gates need `evidence` that exists
(a dead link is blocking) and should carry `certifies` — the tree hash they
certify, quoted; a newer substantive change makes them `stale`, never silently
green.

## petitiones/<id>.md

Petitiones are for questions *not* about one opus (scope, aerarium, lex, routing); `opus` is optional. Item questions are gates.

```yaml
---
id: A-1               # must equal the filename
opus: W-004           # optional; must exist if given
from: eng-lead         # a sella, or the patron
to: patron
state: needs_you      # needs_you (to must be the patron) | awaiting_reply (from must be the patron) | resolved
opened: 2026-09-17T09:58:00Z
---
The question, in one paragraph. Only petitiones that change material direction.
```

## acta/<date>-<slug>.md

```yaml
---
author: art-lead      # a sella, or the patron
kind: consultation    # consultation | decision | daily
title: Status icons go flat, not skeuomorphic
at: 2026-09-17T09:10:00Z
evidence:
  - { label: contact sheet, href: art/sheets/icons-v2.md }   # must exist
---
The choice and the reason. Silence binds nothing.
```

Each magister owes one `daily` per day; a missing or old daily is an advisory.

## aerarium/<period>.yml and usage.yml

```yaml
# allowances only, Patron-written; burn is derived from item tokens / usage events
period: 2026-W38
collegia:
  engineering: { stipendium_tokens: 3000000 }
```

```yaml
providers:
  - { id: claude, usage_pct: 81, reset_at: 2026-09-18T14:00:00Z, status: conserve }
```

Posture per collegium is derived from burn/allowance (≥60% conserve,
≥85% closeout, ≥100% limited; no data → unknown). It is never self-declared.
Any `burn*` key in an aerarium file is blocking: burn is derived, never mirrored.

`bisellium providers [dir] --source auto|usage|quota-axi` prints this same
per-provider shape. `usage` reads `usage.yml` only; `quota-axi` shells out to
the live `quota-axi` CLI (never blocking `check`, `run` or `verify` when it's
absent, unauthenticated, or slow — it degrades to a note within 60s);
`auto` (the default) composites both, a live quota-axi reading for a
provider id always taking precedence over `usage.yml`'s for that same id.

## Running check

```bash
npm run check -- examples/sample-studio
```

Exit 0 passes, 1 has blocking findings, 2 means not a studio (or a usage
error). `--json` gives machine-readable findings with stable rule ids;
`--level block` limits output to what blocks; `--now <iso>` pins the clock for
reproducible age checks; `--repo <dir>` additionally checks each automated
gate's `certifies` against that repo's current tree, advising
`probatio.certifies.stale` (or `.mismatch`) rather than failing — a staleness
check is never a reason for `check` itself to block. `npm test` runs the
sample and every fixture.

## Running run and verify

```bash
npm run bisellium -- run --sella <sella> --studio <dir> -- <cmd…>
npm run bisellium -- verify <opus-id> --studio <dir> --repo <dir>
```

`run` executes `<cmd…>` as `<sella>`, in its own git worktree by default
(`--no-worktree` runs in place; `--base <ref>` sets the worktree's start
point; `--keep` keeps it even when clean), and always leaves a receipt under
`receipts/<sella>/`. `verify` runs every `kind: automated` probatio's
`command` against `--repo` (defaulting to the studio's parent repo) and
writes each one's `status`/`evidence`/`certifies` back into that opus's front
matter — the only tool-written change to an opus, and it touches only those
three keys.
